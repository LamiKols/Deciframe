GITHUB UPLOAD CHECKLIST - SEQUENTIAL DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- utils/ folder uploaded (currency.py, date.py working)

üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
‚ñ° Upload auth/ folder with fixed auth/__init__.py
  - CRITICAL: Change line 5 to "from . import routes"
  - Expected result: Resolves "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'auth'"
  - Deployment should proceed past current blocker

üìã NEXT UPLOADS (in order):
‚ñ° problems/ folder (import on line 459)
‚ñ° business/ folder (import on line 462) 
‚ñ° projects/ folder (import on line 465)
‚ñ° solutions/ folder (import on line 468)
‚ñ° dept/ folder (import on line 471)
‚ñ° predict/ folder (import on line 474)
‚ñ° reports/ folder (import on line 477)
‚ñ° notifications/ folder (import on line 480)
‚ñ° ai/ folder (import on line 483)

üéØ DEPLOYMENT TESTING STRATEGY:
1. Upload auth/ ‚Üí Test deployment (should fix current error)
2. Upload problems/ ‚Üí Test deployment (next likely error)
3. Upload business/ ‚Üí Test deployment
4. Continue until all core modules working
5. Add optional modules (review/, search/, etc.) as needed

‚ö†Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT MONITORING:
- Each upload will trigger automatic Render rebuild
- Monitor logs for next "ModuleNotFoundError" 
- Upload modules in sequence to isolate issues
- Core functionality requires all Phase 2 modules
