PHASED GITHUB UPLOAD STRATEGY FOR COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT

Based on app.py blueprint imports analysis, here are the modules needed in priority phases:

========================================
PHASE 1: CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS
========================================
1. auth/ folder (HIGHEST PRIORITY - currently failing)
   - Fix: auth/__init__.py (change line 5: from . import routes)
   - Contains: routes.py, forms.py, templates/, __init__.py

2. utils/ folder (ALREADY UPLOADED - working)
   - Contains: currency.py, date.py, __init__.py

========================================
PHASE 2: CORE BUSINESS MODULES
========================================
3. business/ folder
   - Required by: from business.routes import business_bp

4. problems/ folder  
   - Required by: from problems.routes import problems_bp

5. projects/ folder
   - Required by: from projects.routes import projects_bp

6. solutions/ folder
   - Required by: from solutions.routes import solutions_bp

7. dept/ folder
   - Required by: from dept.routes import dept

========================================
PHASE 3: CORE FUNCTIONALITY MODULES
========================================
8. ai/ folder
   - Required by: from ai.routes import ai_bp

9. predict/ folder
   - Required by: from predict.routes import predict_bp

10. reports/ folder
    - Required by: from reports.routes import reports_bp

11. notifications/ folder
    - Required by: from notifications.config_routes import notifications_config_bp

========================================
PHASE 4: OPTIONAL MODULES (try/except wrapped)
========================================
12. review/ folder
13. search/ folder  
14. help/ folder
15. waitlist/ folder
16. public/ folder
17. dashboards/ folder
18. monitoring/ folder
19. settings/ folder

========================================
PHASE 5: SUPPORTING FILES
========================================
20. templates/ folder (all HTML templates)
21. static/ folder (CSS, JS, images)
22. workflows/ folder (automation)
23. analytics/ folder (ML models)
24. scheduled/ folder (background jobs)

========================================
DEPLOYMENT PRIORITY ORDER:
========================================
IMMEDIATE: auth/ (fixes current blocker)
CRITICAL: business/, problems/, projects/, solutions/, dept/
IMPORTANT: ai/, predict/, reports/, notifications/
OPTIONAL: All others (app has try/except handling)

Start with Phase 1 (auth/) to fix immediate deployment failure,
then proceed through phases as needed.
