# üõ°Ô∏è DECIFRAME MULTI-TENANT SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY RESOLVED - July 8, 2025

### **API ENDPOINT SECURITY BREACH FIXED**
**Issue**: `/api/users` endpoint was returning ALL users across organizations, exposing cross-tenant data in organizational unit manager dropdowns.

**Root Cause**: Line 1591 in admin_working.py: `users = User.query.all()` - no organization filtering

**Fix Applied**: 
```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE)
users = User.query.all()

# AFTER (SECURE) 
users = User.query.filter_by(organization_id=current_user.organization_id).all()
```

### **CROSS-TENANT DATA EXPOSURE CONFIRMED**
From SQL verification:
```
Organization 1: info@sonartealchemy.com, lami.kolade@gmail.com (2 users)
Organization 2: ruth.kolade@gmail.com (1 user)  
Organization 3: Jay@mynewcompany.com (1 user)
```

**Security Impact**: Users creating organizational units could see and select managers from other organizations, violating multi-tenant data isolation.

## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY STATUS - PRODUCTION READY
