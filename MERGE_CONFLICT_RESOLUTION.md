# Merge Conflict Resolution Complete - July 8, 2025

## Status: âœ… ALL CONFLICTS RESOLVED

### Conflicts Fixed:
1. **utils/currency.py** - Removed duplicate return statement conflict markers
2. **utils/date.py** - Resolved duplicate return statement in format_datetime function
3. **replit.md** - Merged current implementation status with deployment documentation
4. **Application Startup** - Confirmed working with successful Gunicorn start

### Current Application State:
- âœ… Application running successfully on port 5000
- âœ… Authentication system functional (user info@sonartealchemy.com logged in)
- âœ… Utils modules (currency, date) working properly
- âœ… Organization preferences system operational
- âœ… Theme toggle system active

### Deployment Issue Status:
- **ROOT CAUSE**: auth/templates/ directory missing from GitHub repository
- **LOCAL STATUS**: Templates exist and working locally
- **PRODUCTION IMPACT**: Render deployment failing with TemplateNotFound errors

## Next Steps for Deployment Fix:

### Manual Git Operations Required:
Since Replit has git restrictions, these commands need to be run manually:

```bash
# 1. Stage all resolved changes
git add .

# 2. Commit the merge resolution and auth templates
git commit -m "ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT FIX: Resolve merge conflicts and add missing auth templates

- Fixed merge conflicts in utils/currency.py and utils/date.py
- Resolved replit.md documentation conflicts  
- Add complete auth/templates/ directory to fix Render TemplateNotFound errors
- Include login.html, register.html, profile.html, and base.html templates
- Enhanced auth blueprint configuration for proper template resolution
- Resolves production deployment failure on Render"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Expected Result:
- GitHub repository will contain complete auth/templates/ directory
- Render deployment will find templates and stop failing
- Production authentication system will work properly

### Verification:
After successful push, verify:
1. GitHub repository shows auth/templates/ directory with 4 HTML files
2. Trigger new Render deployment
3. Production login/register routes should work without TemplateNotFound errors

## Technical Details:

### Files Added:
- auth/templates/login.html (fixed OIDC route references)
- auth/templates/register.html (complete registration form)
- auth/templates/profile.html (user profile interface)
- auth/templates/base.html (auth-specific base template)

### Blueprint Enhancement:
- auth/__init__.py updated with explicit template_folder path
- Proper template resolution for auth blueprint routes

### Conflict Resolution:
- Preserved all functionality while merging divergent branches
- Maintained debug logging and organization preference features
- Kept latest implementation documentation in replit.md
