CRITICAL AUTH MODULE FIX FOR GITHUB DEPLOYMENT

Fixed circular import issue in auth/__init__.py:

BEFORE (causing ModuleNotFoundError):
from auth import routes

AFTER (fixed relative import):
from . import routes

This resolves the deployment error:
"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'auth'" at line 400 in app.py

The auth blueprint now imports correctly and the deployment should proceed successfully.
