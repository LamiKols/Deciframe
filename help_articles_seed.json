      "content": "# Understanding Project Lifecycle Statuses\n\nLearn how projects progress through different statuses in DeciFrame and what each status means for project stakeholders.\n\n## Project Status Overview\n\nProjects in DeciFrame follow a structured lifecycle with clear status transitions that help track progress and ensure proper governance.\n\n### Status Definitions\n\n#### **Open** 📋\n- **Description**: Newly created project, planning phase\n- **Next Actions**: Define scope, assign team, set milestones\n- **Who Can Update**: Project Manager, Admin\n- **Typical Duration**: 1-2 weeks\n\n#### **In Progress** ⚙️\n- **Description**: Active development and execution\n- **Next Actions**: Complete milestones, track deliverables\n- **Who Can Update**: Project Manager, Team Members\n- **Typical Duration**: Varies by project scope\n\n#### **On Hold** ⏸️\n- **Description**: Temporarily paused due to dependencies or resources\n- **Next Actions**: Resolve blockers, update timeline\n- **Who Can Update**: Project Manager, Sponsor\n- **Typical Duration**: 1-4 weeks\n\n#### **Resolved** ✅\n- **Description**: Successfully completed with all deliverables\n- **Next Actions**: Final documentation, lessons learned\n- **Who Can Update**: Project Manager, Sponsor\n- **Typical Duration**: N/A (final status)\n\n## Status Transition Rules\n\n### Allowed Transitions\n\n```\nOpen → In Progress: When project kickoff occurs\nIn Progress → On Hold: When blockers arise\nIn Progress → Resolved: When project completes successfully\nOn Hold → In Progress: When blockers are resolved\nOn Hold → Resolved: When project is cancelled/completed while on hold\n```\n\n### Restricted Transitions\n- **Resolved → Any Status**: Not allowed (use project versioning instead)\n- **Direct Open → Resolved**: Must pass through In Progress\n\n![Project Status Flow](screenshot-project-flow.png)\n\n## Status-Specific Workflows\n\n### Open Status Workflows\n\n#### Required Activities\n1. **Project Charter**: Define objectives and scope\n2. **Team Assignment**: Assign Project Manager and team members\n3. **Milestone Planning**: Create project milestones with dates\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation\n5. **Budget Approval**: Confirm funding and resource allocation\n\n#### Completion Criteria for Transition to \"In Progress\"\n- ✅ Project Manager assigned\n- ✅ Initial milestones defined\n- ✅ Team members identified\n- ✅ Budget approved\n- ✅ Kickoff meeting scheduled\n\n### In Progress Status Workflows\n\n#### Active Management\n- **Weekly Status Updates**: Progress reporting\n- **Milestone Tracking**: Monitor deliverable completion\n- **Risk Management**: Address issues as they arise\n- **Resource Management**: Adjust team assignments\n- **Stakeholder Communication**: Regular updates to sponsors\n\n#### Milestone Management\n```\nMilestone: Requirements Analysis\nStatus: Completed ✅\nDue Date: 2025-07-10\nActual: 2025-07-08\nDeliverables: Requirements document, user stories\n```\n\n### On Hold Status Management\n\n#### Reasons for Hold Status\n- **Resource Constraints**: Key team members unavailable\n- **Dependencies**: Waiting for external deliverables\n- **Budget Issues**: Funding approval delays\n- **Technical Blockers**: Architecture or technical challenges\n- **Business Changes**: Shifting priorities or requirements\n\n#### Hold Status Best Practices\n1. **Document Reason**: Clear explanation for the hold\n2. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze schedule and budget effects\n3. **Resolution Plan**: Steps to remove blockers\n4. **Communication**: Notify all stakeholders\n5. **Regular Review**: Weekly status checks\n\n### Resolved Status Procedures\n\n#### Project Closure Activities\n1. **Deliverable Acceptance**: Stakeholder sign-off\n2. **Documentation**: Final project documentation\n3. **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights for future projects\n4. **Resource Release**: Team member reassignment\n5. **Budget Reconciliation**: Final financial accounting\n\n#### Success Metrics Tracking\n- **On-Time Delivery**: Actual vs. planned completion\n- **Budget Performance**: Actual vs. budgeted costs\n- **Quality Metrics**: Defect rates, user satisfaction\n- **Business Value**: ROI achievement, benefit realization\n\n## Real Project Examples\n\n### Example 1: Customer Portal Enhancement\n\n**Project Timeline**:\n```\nOpen (Week 1-2):\n- Requirements gathering\n- Team assignment: 3 developers, 1 designer, 1 PM\n- Budget approved: $75,000\n\nIn Progress (Week 3-12):\n- Sprint 1: User interface design ✅\n- Sprint 2: Backend development ✅ \n- Sprint 3: Integration testing ✅\n- Sprint 4: User acceptance testing ✅\n\nResolved (Week 13):\n- Go-live successful\n- User training completed\n- Documentation delivered\n```\n\n### Example 2: Workflow Automation (With Hold)\n\n**Project Timeline**:\n```\nOpen (Week 1-2):\n- Business case analysis\n- Vendor evaluation\n- Team formation\n\nIn Progress (Week 3-6):\n- Vendor selection ✅\n- Initial configuration ⚠️ Technical issues discovered\n\nOn Hold (Week 7-10):\n- Reason: Vendor API limitations\n- Resolution: Vendor provided updated API\n- Impact: 3-week delay, no budget impact\n\nIn Progress (Week 11-16):\n- Updated implementation with new API ✅\n- Testing and deployment ✅\n\nResolved (Week 17):\n- Automation live and processing transactions\n- 40% efficiency improvement achieved\n```\n\n## Status Reporting and Analytics\n\n### Dashboard Metrics\n\n#### Project Status Distribution\n- Open: 5 projects (15%)\n- In Progress: 22 projects (65%)\n- On Hold: 4 projects (12%)\n- Resolved: 3 projects (8%)\n\n#### Performance Indicators\n- **Average Time to Start**: 8 days (Target: 7 days)\n- **On-Time Completion Rate**: 85% (Target: 90%)\n- **Projects On Hold**: 4 (Target: <3)\n- **Budget Variance**: +2% (Target: ±5%)\n\n### Stakeholder Communication\n\n#### Status Update Templates\n\n**Weekly Project Status Email**:\n```\nProject: Customer Portal Enhancement\nStatus: In Progress ⚙️\nCompletion: 75%\nMilestones This Week:\n✅ User acceptance testing completed\n⚙️ Performance optimization in progress\n📅 Go-live scheduled for July 25\n\nRisks/Issues:\n⚠️ Minor performance concern - mitigation in progress\n\nNext Week:\n- Final performance tuning\n- Production deployment preparation\n- User training sessions\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Status Management\n1. **Regular Updates**: Update status weekly minimum\n2. **Clear Communication**: Explain status changes to stakeholders\n3. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed status change logs\n4. **Proactive Management**: Address issues before they require status changes\n\n### Milestone Alignment\n- Align milestone completion with status updates\n- Use milestone progress to inform status decisions\n- Communicate milestone achievements to build confidence\n\n### Stakeholder Engagement\n- Include stakeholders in status transition decisions\n- Provide regular status reports with context\n- Celebrate status milestones and achievements",
