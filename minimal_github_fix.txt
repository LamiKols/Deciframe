CRITICAL GITHUB UPLOAD REQUIRED FOR DEPLOYMENT FIX

The deployment is failing because the auth module fix hasn't been uploaded to GitHub yet.

REQUIRED FILE CHANGE:
File: auth/__init__.py
Current content causing error:
```
from flask import Blueprint

bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, template_folder='templates')

from auth import routes
```

MUST BE CHANGED TO:
```
from flask import Blueprint

bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, template_folder='templates')

from . import routes
```

CRITICAL: Change line 5 from "from auth import routes" to "from . import routes"

This single line change will resolve the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'auth'" error and allow deployment to succeed.

The issue is a circular import where the auth module tries to import from itself, creating an infinite loop during import resolution on the deployment server.
