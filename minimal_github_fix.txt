GITHUB FIX FOR LINE 34 INDENTATION ERROR:

Current INCORRECT structure in GitHub (causing error):
```
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass
    db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)  # ← WRONG: This is indented inside the class
```

Required CORRECT structure:
```
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)  # ← CORRECT: This must be at module level (no indentation)
```

EXACT FIX STEPS:
1. Go to: https://github.com/LamiKols/Deciframe/edit/main/app.py
2. Find line 34: `    db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)`
3. Remove the 4 spaces at the beginning of line 34
4. Ensure there's a blank line between the class and the db initialization
5. Commit with message: "Fix indentation error on line 34"

The line should look like:
db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)

NOT:
    db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)
