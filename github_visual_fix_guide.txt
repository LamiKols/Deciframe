VISUAL GUIDE: WHERE TO ADD THE BLANK LINE

CURRENT GITHUB STRUCTURE (INCORRECT):
```
line 32: class Base(DeclarativeBase):
line 33:     pass
line 34:     db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)  ← REMOVE 4 SPACES HERE
line 35: migrate = Migrate()
```

CORRECTED STRUCTURE NEEDED:
```
line 32: class Base(DeclarativeBase):
line 33:     pass
line 34:                                        ← ADD BLANK LINE HERE
line 35: db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)      ← MOVE THIS TO NO INDENTATION
line 36: migrate = Migrate()
```

STEP-BY-STEP VISUAL FIX:

1. In GitHub editor, find these lines:
   class Base(DeclarativeBase):
       pass
       db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)

2. Change them to look like this:
   class Base(DeclarativeBase):
       pass
   
   db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)

WHAT TO DO:
- Remove the 4 spaces before "db = SQLAlchemy"
- Add an empty line between "pass" and "db = SQLAlchemy"
- The db line should start at column 1 (no indentation)
