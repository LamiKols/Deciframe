- `templates/admin/dashboard.html` - Fixed URL routing issues

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed `UndefinedError: 'health_metrics' is undefined`
- Added missing `pending_metrics`, `role_distribution`, `alerts`, `triage_activity` variables
- Created proper template context for admin dashboard rendering

### 2. URL Routing Corrections
**Broken Routes Fixed:**
- `admin.run_triage_rules` → `run_triage_now`
- `admin.quick_stats` → disabled (route not available)
