## âœ… FIRST USER ADMIN ACCESS FIX - IMPLEMENTED

### Unrestricted Admin Access for Organization Setup
- **CONTEXT PROCESSOR**: Added inject_first_user_admin() context processor in app.py
- **LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION**: 
  - Checks if user is first and only user in their organization (org_users == 1)
  - Grants unrestricted_admin access for Admin role users
  - Allows immediate full admin access without department restrictions
- **TEMPLATE INTEGRATION**: Updated navbar.html to show Admin Center with (First User) indicator
- **HELPER FUNCTION**: Added is_first_user_in_org() function in auth/routes.py

### Business Logic Implementation
```python
@app.context_processor 
def inject_first_user_admin():
    """Inject first user admin access context for unrestricted admin setup"""
    unrestricted_admin = False
    if current_user.is_authenticated:
        from models import User
        org_users = User.query.filter_by(organization_id=current_user.organization_id).count()
        if org_users == 1 and current_user.role == RoleEnum.Admin:
            unrestricted_admin = True
    return dict(unrestricted_admin=unrestricted_admin)
```

### Template Usage Pattern
```jinja2
{% if (current_user and current_user.role and current_user.role.value == 'Admin') or unrestricted_admin %}
  <!-- Show full admin UI -->
  Admin Center{% if unrestricted_admin %} <small>(First User)</small>{% endif %}
{% endif %}
